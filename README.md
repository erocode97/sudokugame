<p style="color: #FF7A59">I wanted to provide a project update regarding the first Sudoku application that I developed.I planned to update the application's user interface (UI) by enhancing the start screen and adding light and dark mode options.

I'm pleased to inform you that I have completed the project update, which only involves updating the start screen and implementing light and dark mode.

To begin, I designed a start screen that better aligns with the overall aesthetic of the application. The designed screen includes new graphics, colors, and fonts that are visually appealing and easy to read. Once completed, I implemented the new start screen into the main activity of the application, ensuring it is displayed when the app is launched.

In addition, I added a light and dark mode option that allows the user to toggle between color schemes. This option was added to the settings or preferences section of the application, allowing users to choose their preferred color scheme. I then updated the design of the application to reflect the user's selection, ensuring that the app looks great in both light and dark modes.

Throughout the project, I thoroughly tested the updated Sudoku application to ensure that it functions correctly and looks good in both light and dark modes. I made any necessary tweaks and adjustments to the design and code to achieve the desired result.

Overall, I believe this project update will enhance the user experience of the Sudoku application without altering its basic functionality. Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback.

Thank You
