Hello,

In this project, I developed the Sudoku game using JavaScript. In its first version, there was a playground with buttons to start and solve, where users could choose from a choice of levels.

However, with the second update, I completed the project and added the game screen and results sections. Users can now play Sudoku in a full-screen playground and see the results at the end of the game. This update has also improved error checks so users can more easily identify and correct incorrectly entered values.

During the project, I made an effort to eliminate code duplication and optimize code structures. In this way, I have increased the code to become more readable and less likely to have errors.

My aim with this project was to enable users to have a more enjoyable experience while playing the Sudoku game. I hope this project will be an interesting and fun experience for Sudoku lovers and maybe inspire them to develop their own projects using JavaScript.

Thank you, good games!

<p style="color: #FF7A59">I wanted to provide a project update regarding the first Sudoku application that I developed.I planned to update the application's user interface (UI) by enhancing the start screen and adding light and dark mode options.

I'm pleased to inform you that I have completed the project update, which only involves updating the start screen and implementing light and dark mode.

To begin, I designed a start screen that better aligns with the overall aesthetic of the application. The designed screen includes new graphics, colors, and fonts that are visually appealing and easy to read. Once completed, I implemented the new start screen into the main activity of the application, ensuring it is displayed when the app is launched.

In addition, I added a light and dark mode option that allows the user to toggle between color schemes. This option was added to the settings or preferences section of the application, allowing users to choose their preferred color scheme. I then updated the design of the application to reflect the user's selection, ensuring that the app looks great in both light and dark modes.

Throughout the project, I thoroughly tested the updated Sudoku application to ensure that it functions correctly and looks good in both light and dark modes. I made any necessary tweaks and adjustments to the design and code to achieve the desired result.

Overall, I believe this project update will enhance the user experience of the Sudoku application without altering its basic functionality. Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback.

Thank You
